# ListsApp
## Usage
Unfortunetly until I have published the application on the app store, there is not an easy way of trying out the application for yourself. There are licenses that require setup, and you also need an iphone, and an open IP address to run the server on. So for recruiters please do take a look at the code, everything is well commented and designed, however actually testing the application will require more effort than you will want to give.
## Purpose
This project has been a chance for me to learn a lot of things surrounding cloud computing and full stack application development. I continue to work towards getting the application up on the Apple App Store.
