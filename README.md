# ListsApp
## Usage
Unfortunetly until I have published the application on the app store, their is not a easy way of trying out the application for yourself. There are licenses that require setup, and you also need a iphone, and an open IP address. So for recruiters please do take a look at the code, everything is well commented and designed, however I think actually testing the application will require more effort than you will want to give.
## Purpose
This project has been a chance for me to learn a lot of things surrounding cloud computing and full stack application development. I continue to work towards getting the application up on the Apple App Store.
